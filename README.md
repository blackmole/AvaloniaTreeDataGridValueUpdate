Shows a problem with raising a change in the underlaying model of TreeDataGrid. Only difference between the two TreeDataGrids is another int text column in the HierarchicalTreeDataGridSource, the model is the same.
The Folder is updating its size when the items are moved, so it raises a PropertyChanged when the collection changes. This is also executed, but from the left grid only every second time the getter of the size is called.
